# Test Generation

## Purpose
To generate and expand test code using pytest.

## Input
- Source code file path
- Function/method name to be tested

## Output
- A new or updated test file with pytest test cases.
- A summary of the generated tests.

## Steps
1. Analyze the specified source code file to understand its structure and dependencies.
2. Identify the logic, branches, and potential edge cases of the function/method to be tested.
3. Generate comprehensive test cases, including positive, negative, and boundary scenarios.
4. Write test code using the `pytest` framework, including necessary assertions.
5. Place the generated test code in the appropriate test file, or create a new one if it doesn't exist.
6. Ensure the generated code is syntactically correct and follows common testing conventions.

## Running Generated Tests
The following commands can be used to run the tests generated by this skill:
- `pytest`
- `pytest tests/`
- `pytest tests/test_module.py::test_function`
